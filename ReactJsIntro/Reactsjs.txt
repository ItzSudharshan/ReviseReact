React JS: A JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, created by Facebook. It helps developers manage changes quickly and easily by breaking the site into smaller, reusable parts called components

Why is React JS Important?
Developer Happiness: Coding with React is easier and more fun. It removes the need to manage every small detail, so developers can focus on building great features. Happy developers make better products.

Reusability: React lets you create components that you can reuse on your entire website. Imagine you make a perfect 'Buy Now' button. Instead of making it from scratch every time, you can use the same button everywhere you need it.

Fast Updates with Virtual DOM: React uses something called the Virtual DOM to make changes fast. When you add an item to your cart on Swiggy, you do not want the whole page to reload. React makes sure only the parts that need changes get updated, like adding a new item to your cart without reloading everything.

Component-Based Structure: React helps you break your website into smaller parts called components. Think about Swiggy's pageâ€”there is a restaurant list, a menu, and a cart. Each of these is a separate component. With React, you can manage each part on its own, keeping the website organized and easy to update.
